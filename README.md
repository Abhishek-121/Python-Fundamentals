# Tic-Tac-Toe
It is a 2 player game developed using fundamentals of python. 

I have explained the code in number of steps so that it is understable to begineer also.

In this we use 'X' and 'O' to fill the cell and check the condition like winning , full space occupied etc. and 
also have the option to replay this game any number of times without closing the window.
